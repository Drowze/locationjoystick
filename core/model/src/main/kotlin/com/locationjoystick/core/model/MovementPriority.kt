/**
 * Precedence when movement engines overlap:
 * 1. A **playing** route (`ROUTE_REPLAY` + `RUNNING`) owns the tick. Joystick is ignored
 *    and starting roam is a no-op.
 * 2. A **paused** route yields the tick to the joystick (mode stays `ROUTE_REPLAY`) and allows
 *    roam start. Starting roam must stop the
 *    paused replay first so two engines never write position together.
 * 3. **Playing** roam owns the tick over joystick. **Paused** roam yields to the joystick
 *    (mode stays `ROAMING`). Roam pause is [isRoamingPaused], not [MockLocationState.PAUSED].
 * 4. Walk-to yields while its own pause flag is set. Follower always owns the tick.
 *
 * Those rules only gate the joystick's own ticks (e.g. a retained locked-stick direction). A new
 * touch that moves the stick past the dead zone pauses automatic movement before steering.
